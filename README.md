# cell_det_seg

This project is for nucleus/cell detection and segmentation in pathology images.
This project includes three networks: 1) HED network implemented using Tensorflow; 2) nuclues/cell size prediction network based on VGG16 implemented using Keras and Tensorflow;  3) Nucleus/cell segmentation based on convolutional variational autoencoder trained in a multi-task learning setting. The system runs faster than MaskRCNN network and produce similar performance.
More details are on the way.

The trained models will be soon available on a dropbox link. Coming soon... (04/17/2019)
